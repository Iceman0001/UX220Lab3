    <p>The minions is the best movie I ever watched, It was fun and entertaining. Even though they speak in a strange language the producers found a way to make everything they do understandable. </p>
    <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">The plot is focused on the three pals Kevin, Stuart and Bob although there is millions of minions.</p>
    <p style="background-color: antiquewhite;">The three go on a quest to find a master to serve this leads them to the world first ever female villain Scarlet Overkill in the United Kingdom. </p>
